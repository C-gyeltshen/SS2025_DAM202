# My Journey Learning RNNs: Weather Prediction Project 🌤️

### [Code Repository](https://github.com/C-gyeltshen/RNN-Architecture.git)

Hi there! This is my practical assignment on implementing a **Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for weather prediction. As a student diving into deep learning, this project helped me understand how RNNs work with time series data using real Bangladesh weather data from 1990-2023.

## 🎯 My Project Overview

For this assignment, I built my first **Simple RNN** to predict tomorrow's temperature based on the past 5 days of weather data. It was exciting to see how neural networks can learn patterns from sequential data!

### What Makes This Project Special ✨

- 🤖 My first hands-on experience with RNNs
- 📊 Working with real-world weather data (33+ years worth!)
- 💡 Learning how to handle time series data step by step
- 🎨 Creating cool visualizations to understand my model
- 📈 Understanding when Simple RNNs work (and when they don't)
- 🧠 Building intuition about sequential learning

## 📊 The Dataset I Worked With

### My Data Story

I got to work with an amazing dataset from Bangladesh with over 12,000 daily weather records! Here's what made it interesting:

- **My Dataset**: `weather_data.csv`
- **Size**: 12,115 daily observations (that's a lot!)
- **Time Span**: 1990-2023 (longer than I've been alive! 😄)
- **Location**: Bangladesh
- **Challenge**: Predicting temperature from other weather variables

### What Weather Variables I Used

Learning to work with real data was exciting! Here's what each column meant:

| What I Called It  | What It Actually Means           | Why It's Important                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Year              | Which year the reading was taken | Helps with long-term trends             |
| Day               | Day of the year (1-365)          | Captures seasonal patterns              |
| Wind Speed        | How fast the wind was blowing    | Affects how temperature feels           |
| Specific Humidity | Actual water vapor in air        | More precise than relative humidity     |
| Relative Humidity | Percentage of moisture (0-100%)  | What we usually hear in weather reports |
| Precipitation     | How much it rained               | Rain affects temperature a lot!         |
| **Temperature**   | The actual temperature in °C     | **This is what I'm trying to predict!** |

### The Tough Parts (Data Preprocessing)

This was probably the hardest part for me as a student:

- **Cleaning Data**: Some values were missing - had to figure out how to fill them
- **Making New Features**: I learned to create month info and moving averages (so cool!)
- **Scaling Everything**: Had to squish all numbers between 0 and 1 (MinMax scaling)
- **Handling Bad Data**: Some readings were way off - learned about outliers and IQR
- **Final Result**: Turned 7 original features into 9 smart features! 🎉

## 🏗️ How I Built the RNN

### My First Neural Network Architecture!

Building my first RNN was like solving a puzzle. Here's how I put it together:

```python
My Input → SimpleRNN (the magic happens here) → Dropout → Final Prediction
(9 features,     (32 neurons remembering        (prevents      (tomorrow's
 5 days)          the past 5 days)               overfitting)    temperature)
```

### The Settings I Chose (and Why)

As a beginner, I had to learn what each setting means:

- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) - because I'm predicting numbers, not categories
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001 - my professor said this is a good starting point
- **Batch Size**: 32 - found this works well on my laptop
- **Epochs**: 100 (but usually stopped earlier thanks to early stopping)
- **Sequence Length**: 5 days - after experiments, this worked best for Simple RNN
- **Train/Validation/Test**: 70/15/15 split - keeping time order intact (very important!)

### Why 5 Days?

I experimented with different sequence lengths and learned that Simple RNNs have a "memory problem" - they forget things that happened more than a few days ago. 5 days was the sweet spot! 🎯

## 🚀 Setting Up Everything

### What I Needed on My Computer

Getting started was easier than I thought! Here's what I installed:

```bash
# These are the main libraries I needed
pip install tensorflow      # For building my RNN
pip install numpy pandas   # For handling data
pip install matplotlib seaborn  # For making pretty graphs
pip install scikit-learn   # For data preprocessing
pip install jupyter        # For running my notebook
```

### Getting My Project

If you want to try my code:

```bash
# Download the project (replace with actual link)
git clone <my-repository-url>
cd practical3
```

## 💻 How to Run My Code

### The Easy Way - Just Open My Notebook!

```bash
jupyter notebook practical3.ipynb
```

Then just run all cells and watch the magic happen! ✨

### What You'll See When You Run It:

1. **Data Loading**: My code loads the weather data
2. **Data Exploration**: Cool graphs showing weather patterns
3. **Preprocessing**: Watch the data get cleaned and prepared
4. **Model Training**: See my RNN learn (this is the exciting part!)
5. **Results**: Graphs comparing my predictions to real temperatures
6. **Analysis**: Understanding where my model worked and where it struggled

### If You Want to Use My Trained Model:

```python
# Load my pre-trained model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
my_model = load_model('best_simple_rnn_model.h5')

# Now you can make predictions!
# (You'll need to preprocess your data the same way I did)
```

## 📈 What Results I Got

### My Model's Performance

I was pretty excited about these numbers (though I know there's room for improvement!):

| Metric   | My Result | What This Means                                     |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| RMSE     | ~X.XX°C   | On average, I'm off by this many degrees            |
| MAE      | ~X.XX°C   | The typical error in my predictions                 |
| R² Score | ~0.XX     | How well my model explains the temperature patterns |
| MAPE     | ~XX%      | My percentage error (lower is better!)              |

### How Often Was I Close?

This was the most satisfying part - seeing how often my predictions were close:

- **±1°C Accuracy**: ~XX% (Pretty good for day-to-day planning!)
- **±2°C Accuracy**: ~XX% (Definitely useful for weather awareness)
- **±3°C Accuracy**: ~XX% (Still reasonable for general trends)

### The Cool Graphs I Made 📊

Creating visualizations helped me understand my model so much better:

- � **Training Progress**: Watching my model learn over 100 epochs
- 🌡️ **Actual vs Predicted**: Side-by-side temperature comparison
- 🎯 **Scatter Plot**: How well my predictions correlate with reality
- � **Error Patterns**: When and why my model makes mistakes
- 🕒 **Time Analysis**: Seeing if errors happen at specific times

The most exciting moment was seeing my predicted line follow the actual temperature curve! 🎉

## Challenges I Faced

### The Reality Check - Simple RNN Limitations

As a student, learning about my model's limitations was just as important as celebrating its successes:

#### 1. **The Vanishing Gradient Problem** 🫥

- My RNN started "forgetting" things that happened more than a week ago
- This is why I could only use 5-day sequences effectively
- Longer sequences actually made my model worse! (Learned this the hard way)

#### 2. **Short-term Memory Issues** 🧠

- My model couldn't remember seasonal patterns (like "it's usually hot in summer")
- It focused too much on recent days and ignored long-term weather cycles
- This was frustrating when trying to predict seasonal temperature changes

#### 3. **What My Simple RNN Is Actually Good At** ✅

After lots of experimentation, I learned my model works best for:

- **Next 1-3 days**: Pretty reliable predictions
- **Stable weather periods**: When conditions don't change dramatically
- **Learning basic patterns**: Daily temperature fluctuations
- **Quick predictions**: Fast enough for real-time use

#### 4. **When It Struggles** ❌

I had to accept my model isn't great for:

- **Long-term forecasting**: Anything beyond a week
- **Seasonal predictions**: Can't capture monthly/yearly patterns
- **Extreme weather**: Unusual events confuse it
- **Complex interactions**: Multiple weather systems interacting

### My Learning Moments 💡

- **Failed Experiment #1**: Tried 20-day sequences → model got confused
- **Failed Experiment #2**: Tried predicting a week ahead → terrible results
- **Success Story**: Found the sweet spot with 5-day sequences and short-term predictions
